  <h1>Joy, Happiness, Revelation!</h1>
  
  <p>He told me, "I see you rise"
  <p>But, it always falls
  <p>I see you come, I see you go
  <p>He say, "All things pass into the night"
  <p>And I say, "Oh no sir I must say you're wrong
  <p>I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong"
  <p>Won't you listen to me
  <br></br> 
  <p>He told me, I've seen it all before
  <p>I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams
  <p>A lying on the ground
  <p>I've seen the sky just begin to fall
  <p>He say, "All things pass into the night"
  <p>And I say, "Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong
  <p>I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong"
  <p>Won't you listen to me
